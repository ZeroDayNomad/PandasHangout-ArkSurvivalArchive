# A Thank You
As a gamer who's lived and breathed the thrilling existence on the islands of Ark Survival Evolved, I find myself at a loss for words to express my gratitude for the incredible journey our community has enabled. Over the last five years, our servers have not only been the battlegrounds where we've forged our paths as a survivor but also the communities where we've found lifelong companions.

Our decision to archive and share the game save files is a testament to the spirit of gaming and resilience that defines our Ark community. It's more than just data; it's the legacy of countless adventurers and the dreams of those who wish to embark on their own saga of survival. By allowing others to start up their servers with these files, we're igniting new stories and ensuring that the spirit of exploration and challenge lives on.

Your dedication and playtime has been the beacon guiding us through the treacherous landscapes and the architect of countless memories that will be cherished forever. It's not just the end of an era but the dawn of countless new beginnings, thanks to the foundation you've laid down.

The Panda's Hangout community owes you a debt of gratitude for your unwavering support and the legacy you've helped create.

As I look back on the countless hours of gameplay, the triumphs, the defeats, and the unbreakable bonds formed, I do so with a profound sense of gratitude for the role our community has played in shaping these experiences. You've not only preserved a piece of gaming history but also empowered a new generation of gamers to create their own legends.

Here's to the past five incredible years, and to you, for making it all possible. May the future be just as adventurous, with new survivors to tell the tales of their conquests, inspired by the archives we've shared.
